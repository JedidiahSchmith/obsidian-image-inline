# Obsidian-Image-Inline
Sometimes, you just don't want to have images saved as separate files, cluttering your workspace. This plugin addresses that need by allowing you to convert images into base64 encoded strings and embed them directly within your notes. 

## Usage
### Converting Images to Base64
* Using Hotkey: Press Ctrl+Alt+V (or the configured hotkey) to convert an image in the clipboard to a base64 string and embed it in the active note.
* On Paste: If enabled in settings, any image you paste into Obsidian will automatically be converted to a base64 string and embedded.

### Converting Base64 to Image (Not implemented)
Use the command palette to convert a selected base64 string back to an image file.

## Settings
Convert on Paste: Toggle this to enable or disable automatic conversion of pasted images to base64.
Convert with Hotkey: Enable this to use the hotkey for converting images.
